With more than 30 MPs, including Union Ministers Nitin Gadkari and Prahlad Patel, testing positive over the last week, there is a palpable sense of concern and apprehension in Parliament over the spread of Covid. The situation has prompted stricter protocol and raised the possibility of the ongoing Monsoon Session being wound up next week.

The case of BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who had tested negative last Friday, has further rattled parliamentarians. A day after he was the party’s lead speaker for the Covid debate in the Upper House, Sahasrabuddhe said Thursday that he has tested positive after developing a headache and mild fever the previous night.

While wishing him a speedy recovery, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien asked all Members who had come in contact with Sahasrabuddhe or were seated near him to isolate themselves. He also noted that Sahasrabuddhe had delivered a speech from the Treasury benches and would have spent time in the House lobby and Central Hall.
