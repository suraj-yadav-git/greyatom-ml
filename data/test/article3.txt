A day after resigning as Union Minister of Food Processing Industries in protest against three farm Bills that have triggered protests across Punjab, Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assurance on the legislation was too little and too late, and that the Akali Dal had repeatedly raised the matter in the Cabinet.

Speaking to The Indian Express over the phone from Delhi, Harsimrat, the MP from Bathinda, said, “I am grateful he (the PM) has done that (given the assurance). I would have been even more grateful if he had said this a month-and-a-half ago when I was saying farmers wanted an assurance.”
